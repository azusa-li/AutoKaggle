# User Study

We invited five master's students majoring in computer science with experience in Kaggle to evaluate the solutions generated by AutoKaggle/AIDE. We asked them to rate the solutions on eight specified criteria, giving scores from 1 to 5, and to provide at least three reasons for their ratings.

We place the comparison results in `./comparison_results` directory.




## Evaluation Criteria and Explanations

**Code Length**: Measures the number of code lines to compare implementation complexity between the two methods.

**Modularity**: Evaluates the level of modular design by analyzing the usage of functions and classes in the code.

**External Dependencies**: Counts the number of external libraries and tools used to assess code lightweightness.

**Feature Richness**: Evaluates the quantity and diversity of implemented features.

**Comment Coverage**: Measures code readability by calculating the ratio of comment lines to total lines of code.

**Code Reusability**: Assesses how easily the code can be reused or extended.

**Comprehensibility**: Evaluates how easy the code is to understand.

**Overall**: A comprehensive score that weighs all above criteria equally to evaluate the overall quality of the solution.
