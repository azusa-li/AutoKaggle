## QUESTIONS
### Question 1
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.

### Question 2
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. (This is a FIXED question for each phase.)

### Question 3
What new features were created during this phase, and how do they enhance the dataset's potential for model training?

### Question 4
Which existing features were transformed, and what transformations were applied? Were there any issues with the transformations (e.g., zero values in log transformations)?

### Question 5
How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding techniques were employed? Are there any considerations to avoid multicollinearity?

### Question 6
What insights or patterns emerged from the feature engineering phase that may influence the choice of modeling techniques and evaluation metrics in the next phase?
