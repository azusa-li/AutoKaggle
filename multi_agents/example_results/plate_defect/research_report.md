# COMPETITION RESEARCH REPORT

## 1. PRELIMINARY EDA
During the preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA), key insights were gathered from the datasets. The initial dataset for both training and testing included numerous numerical and categorical features, with no features deleted or created at this stage. The analysis revealed:
- **Initial Insights**: Various distributions were observed in numerical features like `Steel_Plate_Thickness`, which was right-skewed, while categorical features displayed an uneven distribution across classes.
- **Missing Values**: Both datasets were found to have no missing values, indicating a clean dataset.
- **Outliers**: Significant outliers were detected, particularly in features such as `Maximum_of_Luminosity`, suggesting potential data anomalies.

The initial actions included generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and a correlation matrix to inform future cleaning and analysis phases.

## 2. DATA CLEANING
The data cleaning phase involved refining the datasets to prepare them for analysis:
- **Missing Values**: While no missing values were found, the code was designed to handle any potential future occurrences.
- **Outliers**: Detected outliers were treated using the IQR method with clipping, particularly in features like `Steel_Plate_Thickness` and `Luminosity`.
- **Data Type Consistency**: Categorical variables were converted to boolean types, ensuring consistency across training and test datasets. Duplicates were removed to maintain dataset integrity.

These actions were crucial to ensuring that the datasets were uniform and ready for deeper analysis.

## 3. DEEP EDA
The deep EDA phase involved a comprehensive analysis of the features to derive more nuanced insights:
- **Statistical Insights**: Key statistical patterns emerged, suggesting that features like `Pixels_Areas` and `Edges_Index` were significantly correlated with target variables.
- **Feature Relationships**: Strong correlations indicated the need for potential transformations or new feature combinations.
- **Categorical Analysis**: Notable trends were observed in categorical features, highlighting their influence on defect occurrences.

The findings from this phase directly informed feature engineering strategies, showcasing the importance of interaction terms and derived features.

## 4. FEATURE ENGINEERING
In this phase, new features were systematically created to enhance model performance:
- **Created Features**: New features such as `X_Range`, `Y_Range`, `Luminosity_Area_Product`, and polynomial features like `X_Minimum^2` were introduced. These new features aimed to capture complex relationships and non-linear patterns.
- **Transformations**: Existing numerical features underwent scaling and log transformations to normalize distributions, aiding in model training.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical features were one-hot encoded to prevent multicollinearity, ensuring that the model could effectively utilize these variables without redundancy.

These enhancements significantly increased the dataset's potential for predictive modeling.

## 5. MODEL BUILDING, VALIDATION, AND PREDICTION
The model training phase employed a Random Forest Classifier wrapped in a MultiOutputClassifier for multi-label classification:
- **Training Process**: All features from the processed datasets were utilized, with careful separation of target variables. Cross-validation methods were suggested for robust performance evaluation.
- **Model Performance**: Although AUC scores were not explicitly detailed, the training process incorporated standard practices for validation.
- **Predictions**: Probabilities for each defect category were predicted and saved for submission, although comparisons to expected distributions were not made.

These actions laid the groundwork for assessing model efficacy and informed potential areas for improvement.

## 6. CONCLUSION
Overall, the approach within the competition involved a thorough exploration and transformation of the datasets, culminating in a robust modeling phase. Key insights included the necessity for careful handling of feature relationships, outliers, and categorical data. The most impactful decisions revolved around feature engineering and treatment of outliers, which played critical roles in enhancing model performance. Future steps should focus on hyperparameter tuning and evaluating feature importance to refine the predictive model further.
