        "agent developer": "1. Limit the number of visualizations in STEP 2 to the top features that show the most variance. 2. Implement functions to encapsulate repetitive plotting code for better maintainability. 3. Provide a clearer summary of insights in STEP 4 to guide feature engineering more effectively.",
        "agent planner": "1. Ensure that each step has a clear focus on the most impactful features to avoid unnecessary complexity. 2. Consider integrating additional steps for data validation to ensure the integrity of the data before analysis. 3. Include a mechanism for feedback collection on the visualizations to iteratively improve the analysis process."
