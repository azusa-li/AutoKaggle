## PLAN

### STEP 1
Task: Conduct Thorough Statistical Analysis on Cleaned Data
- **Tools, Involved Features, and Correct Parameters:**
  - Use pandas' `describe()` method for descriptive statistics.
  - Use pandas' `value_counts()` for categorical features.
  - Compute correlation matrix using pandas' `corr()`.
  - Visualize correlation matrix using seaborn's `heatmap()`.
  - **Features Involved:** All numerical and categorical features.
- **Expected Output or Impact on Data:**
  - Summary statistics for numerical features.
  - Frequency distribution for categorical features.
  - Correlation matrix and heatmap visualization.
- **Constraints:**
  - Ensure no modifications to the dataset, only analysis.
  - Limit the image generation to one heatmap for efficiency.

### STEP 2
Task: Explore Relationships Between Features and Target Variables
- **Tools, Involved Features, and Correct Parameters:**
  - Plot histograms and boxplots for numerical features, stratified by target variables using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Use count plots for categorical features, stratified by target variables.
  - Perform pairwise scatter plots for numerical features against target variables using Seaborn's pairplot or scatterplot with hue.
  - **Features Involved:** All numerical and categorical features.
- **Expected Output or Impact on Data:**
  - Histograms, boxplots, and count plots showing distributions and potential correlations.
  - Scatter plots highlighting relationships between features and target variables.
- **Constraints:**
  - Limit generated images to a maximum of 10, focusing on key features and target variables with the most variance.
  - Ensure efficient plotting, avoid overloading with too many plots.

### STEP 3
Task: Identify Potential Feature Interactions
- **Tools, Involved Features, and Correct Parameters:**
  - Create interaction plots for pairs of features using Seaborn's `lmplot()` or `interaction_plot()` from statsmodels.
  - Perform cross-tabulation for categorical features using pandas' `crosstab()`.
  - **Features Involved:** Selected pairs of numerical features and categorical features.
- **Expected Output or Impact on Data:**
  - Interaction plots showing potential feature interactions.
  - Cross-tabulation tables showing interaction frequencies.
- **Constraints:**
  - Focus on key interactions that show significant variance.
  - Keep tables concise and focused on significant interactions.

### STEP 4
Task: Visualize Key Insights and Patterns
- **Tools, Involved Features, and Correct Parameters:**
  - Create summary plots using bar plots, line plots, or heatmaps as needed with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Provide recommendations for potential feature engineering steps.
  - **Features Involved:** All key features identified from previous tasks.
- **Expected Output or Impact on Data:**
  - Summary visualizations showing key patterns and insights.
  - A list of actionable recommendations for feature engineering.
- **Constraints:**
  - Ensure clarity and avoid redundancy in visualizations.
  - Focus on practical and impactful feature engineering steps.
