# Competition Information
## 1. Competition Overview
The objective of this competition is to predict the probability of various defects on steel plates using synthetic data generated from a deep learning model based on the original Steel Plates Faults dataset. It is designed for participants to practice machine learning skills.

## 2. Files
- **train.csv**: Training dataset containing features and labels for seven types of defects.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset without labels; participants must predict defect probabilities.
- **sample_submission.csv**: Template demonstrating the required format for submissions.

## 3. Problem Definition
Participants must predict the probabilities for seven binary target variables representing different types of defects on steel plates for each `id` in the test dataset.

## 4. Data Information
### 4.1 Data type
#### 4.1.1 ID type
- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point (not used in model training).

#### 4.1.2 Numerical type
- `X_Minimum`, `X_Maximum`, `Y_Minimum`, `Y_Maximum`, `Pixels_Areas`, `X_Perimeter`, `Y_Perimeter`, `Sum_of_Luminosity`, `Minimum_of_Luminosity`, `Maximum_of_Luminosity`, `Length_of_Conveyer`, `Steel_Plate_Thickness`, `Edges_Index`, `Empty_Index`, `Square_Index`, `Outside_X_Index`, `Edges_X_Index`, `Edges_Y_Index`, `Outside_Global_Index`, `LogOfAreas`, `Log_X_Index`, `Log_Y_Index`, `Orientation_Index`, `Luminosity_Index`, `SigmoidOfAreas`.

#### 4.1.3 Categorical type
- `TypeOfSteel_A300`, `TypeOfSteel_A400`, `Pastry`, `Z_Scratch`, `K_Scatch`, `Stains`, `Dirtiness`, `Bumps`, `Other_Faults`.

#### 4.1.4 Datetime type
- None present in the dataset.

### 4.2 Detailed data description
The dataset contains features related to steel plate quality, including measurements and indices. It features a mix of normal and defective samples, which is crucial for classification tasks.

## 5. Target Variable
The target variables to be predicted are:
- `Pastry`
- `Z_Scratch`
- `K_Scatch`
- `Stains`
- `Dirtiness`
- `Bumps`
- `Other_Faults`

Each variable indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a defect.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
Submissions are evaluated using the **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**, calculated for each of the seven defect categories and averaged for the final score.

## 7. Submission Format
The submission file must include:
```
id,Pastry,Z_Scratch,K_Scatch,Stains,Dirtiness,Bumps,Other_Faults
```
Each column consists of the unique `id` and predicted probabilities for the respective defect categories.

## 8. Other Key Aspects
- The dataset is synthetically generated, approximating real-world data.
- Participants can explore the original dataset to understand differences and potentially improve model performance.
- Community engagement through discussions is encouraged for feedback and improvement.
