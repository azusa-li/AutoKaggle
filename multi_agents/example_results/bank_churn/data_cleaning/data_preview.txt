## Detailed data description
The dataset consists of banking customer information, including both train and test data. The train data contains the target variable `Exited`, which indicates whether the customer has exited the bank. The features provided are:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point.
- `CustomerId`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Surname`: Customer's surname, a categorical variable.
- `CreditScore`: Numerical value representing the customer's credit score.
- `Geography`: Categorical value indicating the customer's country (France, Spain, Germany).
- `Gender`: Categorical value indicating the customer's gender (Male, Female).
- `Age`: Numerical value representing the customer's age.
- `Tenure`: Numerical value indicating the number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- `Balance`: Numerical value representing the customer's bank account balance.
- `NumOfProducts`: Numerical value indicating the number of bank products the customer uses.
- `HasCrCard`: Numerical value (binary) indicating whether the customer has a credit card (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- `IsActiveMember`: Numerical value (binary) indicating whether the customer is an active member (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- `EstimatedSalary`: Numerical value representing the customer's estimated salary.

Notable patterns include:
- The `Balance` and `EstimatedSalary` fields have a wide range of values, indicating varying financial statuses among customers.
- The `Geography` and `Gender` fields show categorical diversity.
- `Age` and `Tenure` have typical ranges expected for a banking customer dataset, with age varying from young adults to middle-aged customers, and tenure indicating how long customers have been with the bank.

## Target Variable
The target variable is `Exited`, which indicates whether a customer has exited the bank (1 for exited, 0 for not exited).

# Submission format (if applicable)
When submitting predictions, the required format should include the following columns:

- `Exited`: Predicted value indicating whether the customer has exited the bank (1 for exited, 0 for not exited).

Example submission:
| id      | Exited |
|---------|--------|
| 165034  | 0      |
