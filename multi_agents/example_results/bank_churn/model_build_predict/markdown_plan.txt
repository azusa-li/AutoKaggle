## PLAN

### STEP 1
Task: Data Preparation
- **Objective:** Prepare the data for model training by separating the target variable and removing non-numeric or irrelevant columns.
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - **Tools:** Pandas
  - **Features:** 'Exited' (target variable), 'id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname' (columns to be removed)
  - **Parameters:** None
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - `X_train` and `X_test` datasets with only numeric and relevant features.
  - `y_train` with the target variable extracted.
- **Constraints:**
  - Ensure consistency between training and test sets in terms of features.

### STEP 2
Task: Model Selection and Training
- **Objective:** Train up to three different models to find the best one for predicting customer churn.
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - **Tools:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model`
  - **Features:** All features remaining in `X_train` after data preparation
  - **Parameters:**
    - `problem_type`: 'binary'
    - `selected_models`: `["logistic regression", "random forest", "XGBoost"]`
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - The best performing trained model based on AUC ROC scores.
- **Constraints:**
  - Runtime efficiency, as computational resources are limited.

### STEP 3
Task: Model Validation
- **Objective:** Validate the trained models to evaluate their performance.
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - **Tools:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model`
  - **Features:** Same features as in the training step
  - **Parameters:** None (the tool will automatically perform cross-validation)
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - AUC ROC scores for each model, with the best model selected based on these scores.
- **Constraints:**
  - Ensure that the validation process is consistent and reproducible.

### STEP 4
Task: Model Prediction
- **Objective:** Use the best-performing model to make predictions on the test set.
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - **Tools:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model`, Pandas
  - **Features:** All numeric and relevant features in `X_test`
  - **Parameters:** None
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - A submission file in the required format.
- **Constraints:**
  - Ensure the submission file matches the required format for the competition.
