    Key Insights:
    1. Numerical features such as Age, Balance, and EstimatedSalary show significant variation among customers.
    2. The proportion of exited customers is lower compared to non-exited customers.
    3. Correlation analysis reveals some relationships between features like Age and Balance.
    4. Categorical features like Geography and Gender have distinct distributions across the target variable.
    5. Key feature interactions show specific patterns that might be useful for feature engineering.
    
    Recommendations for Feature Engineering:
    1. Create new features based on interactions between key numerical features (e.g., Balance-to-EstimatedSalary ratio).
    2. Encode categorical features using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
    3. Consider feature scaling for numerical features to improve model performance.
    4. Explore polynomial features or interactions between numerical features to capture more complex relationships.
    5. Perform further analysis to identify potential outliers or anomalies in the data.
