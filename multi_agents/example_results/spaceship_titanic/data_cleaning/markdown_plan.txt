## PLAN

### STEP 1
Task: Handle Missing Values
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **HomePlanet, CryoSleep, Cabin, Destination, VIP, Name**
  - Tool: `fill_missing_values`
  - Method: 'mode'
- **Age, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck**
  - Tool: `fill_missing_values`
  - Method: 'median'
Expected output or Impact on data: 
- No missing values in the specified features.
Constraints: 
- Ensure the method chosen is appropriate for the data type and distribution.

### STEP 2
Task: Treat Outliers
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Age, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck**
  - Tool: `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`
  - Factor: 1.5
  - Method: 'clip'
Expected output or Impact on data: 
- Outliers in the specified features are clipped to acceptable ranges.
Constraints: 
- Ensure the IQR method is appropriate for the data distribution.

### STEP 3
Task: Ensure Data Consistency
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **CryoSleep and Expense Features (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck)**
  - Method: Set expense values to 0 for `CryoSleep` passengers.
Expected output or Impact on data: 
- Consistent data where passengers in CryoSleep have zero expenses.
Constraints: 
- Verify that CryoSleep status is correctly updated before making changes.

### STEP 4
Task: Final Checks and Save Cleaned Data
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Remove Duplicates**
  - Tool: `remove_duplicates`
- **Convert Data Types**
  - Tool: `convert_data_types`
  - Features: 
    - Convert `CryoSleep` and `VIP` to boolean.
    - Convert `Age` and expense features to float.
    - Convert `HomePlanet`, `Cabin`, `Destination`, and `Name` to categorical (string).
Expected output or Impact on data: 
- No duplicate rows and correct data types for each feature.
Constraints: 
- Ensure data integrity is maintained after removing duplicates and converting data types.

### STEP 5
Task: Save Cleaned Datasets
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- Method: Save the cleaned datasets as `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.
Expected output or Impact on data: 
- Two cleaned datasets ready for further analysis and model building.
Constraints: 
- Ensure the saved datasets maintain the required format and structure.
