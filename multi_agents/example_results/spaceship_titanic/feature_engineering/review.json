Exception Handling: Implement specific exception handling for better debugging. 3. Scaling Function: Ensure the scale_features function is defined and documented. 4. Documentation: Add inline comments to clarify complex sections of the code.",
        "agent planner": "1. Clarity in Objectives: Ensure that each step clearly states its objective to avoid ambiguity. 2. Tool Specification: Provide more clarity on the expected behavior of tools used, especially for any custom functions (e.g., 'create_feature_combinations', 'scale_features', 'correlation_feature_selection'). 3. Output Definitions: Clearly define what constitutes successful output for each step (e.g., specific metrics for feature importance). 4. Constraints Awareness: Include more detailed constraints that consider potential data quality issues or missing values that might affect feature engineering."
