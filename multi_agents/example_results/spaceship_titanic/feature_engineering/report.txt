## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.

### Answer 1
- **Processed Files:**
  - Input: 
    - `cleaned_train.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/spaceship_titanic/cleaned_train.csv`
    - `cleaned_test.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/spaceship_titanic/cleaned_test.csv`
  - Output:
    - `processed_train.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/spaceship_titanic/processed_train.csv`
    - `processed_test.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/spaceship_titanic/processed_test.csv`

### Question 2
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. (This is a FIXED question for each phase.)

### Answer 2
- **New Features Created:**
  - Binary flags for expenditures:
    - `RoomService_flag`, `FoodCourt_flag`, `ShoppingMall_flag`, `Spa_flag`, `VRDeck_flag`
  - Age Group:
    - `AgeGroup`
  - Decomposed Cabin Features:
    - `Cabin_deck`, `Cabin_number`, `Cabin_side`
  - Interaction Features (not explicitly shown in output):
    - `HomePlanet_Destination_interaction`, `CryoSleep_RoomService_interaction`

- **Existing Features Transformed:**
  - Log transformations applied to:
    - `RoomService`, `FoodCourt`, `ShoppingMall`, `Spa`, `VRDeck` â†’ New columns: `RoomService_log`, `FoodCourt_log`, etc.
  - Categorical features:
    - One-hot encoded: `HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, `Destination`, `VIP`
    - Label encoded: `Cabin_deck`, `Cabin_side`, `AgeGroup`

- **No Features Deleted:** All original features were retained in some form.

### Question 3
What new features were created during the feature engineering phase, and how do they relate to the target variable 'Transported'?

### Answer 3
- **New Features:**
  - **Expenditure Flags**: Indicate whether a passenger used specific services, potentially correlating with their likelihood of being transported.
  - **Age Group**: Categorizes passengers into age brackets, which may affect their chance of being transported.
  - **Cabin Feature Decomposition**: Provides more granular information about passenger accommodations, which could relate to transport likelihood.
  - **Interaction Features**: Capture relationships between variables that could influence the target, e.g., whether being in CryoSleep affects the outcome based on HomePlanet.

### Question 4
What transformations were applied to existing features, and what impact do these transformations have on the distribution of the data?

### Answer 4
- **Log Transformations**:
  - Applied to expenditure features to reduce skewness and handle zero values effectively. This transformation can stabilize variance and make the distribution more normal, which is beneficial for modeling.

- **One-Hot Encoding**:
  - Converts categorical data into a format that can be provided to ML algorithms, thus enhancing the model's ability to learn from categorical variables.

### Question 5
Which features were selected for modeling based on correlation with the target variable, and what correlation threshold was used?

### Answer 5
- **Correlation Threshold**: A threshold of `0.5` was used to select features based on their correlation with the target variable `Transported`.
- **Selected Features**: The specific features selected were not detailed in the output due to an error during feature selection, but they would typically include those with the strongest relationships to `Transported`.

### Question 6
How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding techniques were applied to ensure they are suitable for modeling?

### Answer 6
- **Encoding Techniques**:
  - **One-Hot Encoding**: Applied to categorical features with fewer unique values (`HomePlanet`, `CryoSleep`, `Destination`, `VIP`), creating binary columns for each category.
  - **Label Encoding**: Applied to categorical features with many unique values (`Cabin_deck`, `Cabin_side`, `AgeGroup`), converting categories to integers.

### Question 7
Were any numerical features normalized or standardized, and what methods were utilized?

### Answer 7
- **Standardization**:
  - Numerical features (`Age`, `RoomService_log`, `FoodCourt_log`, `ShoppingMall_log`, `Spa_log`, `VRDeck_log`) were standardized using a method specified as 'standard', which likely means scaling to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### Question 8
What challenges or inconsistencies were encountered during feature engineering, and how might they affect the next phase of model building?

### Answer 8
- **Challenges**:
  - An error occurred during feature selection due to unsupported operand types, indicating a potential issue with the data type of the features being processed.
  
- **Impact**:
  - This error could lead to incomplete feature selection, which may adversely affect model performance. Ensuring all features are correctly processed and selected is crucial for effective modeling in the next phase.
