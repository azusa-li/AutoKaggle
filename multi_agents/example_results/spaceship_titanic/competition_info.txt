# Competition Information
## 1. Competition Overview
The "Spaceship Titanic" competition challenges participants to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension after a collision with a spacetime anomaly. This engaging narrative sets the stage for a classification problem.

## 2. Files
- **train.csv**: Contains personal records for approximately 8,700 passengers, including the target variable (`Transported`) for training.
- **test.csv**: Includes around 4,300 passenger records without the target variable, used for making predictions.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A template demonstrating the required format for submissions.

## 3. Problem Definition
The task is to classify passengers into two categories: those who were transported to another dimension (True) and those who were not (False).

## 4. Data Information
### 4.1 Data type
#### 4.1.1 ID type
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.

#### 4.1.2 Numerical type
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `RoomService`: Amount billed for room service.
- `FoodCourt`: Amount billed for food court services.
- `ShoppingMall`: Amount billed for shopping mall services.
- `Spa`: Amount billed for spa services.
- `VRDeck`: Amount billed for VR Deck services.

#### 4.1.3 Categorical type
- `HomePlanet`: Planet of origin.
- `CryoSleep`: Indicates if the passenger is in suspended animation.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Destination`: Planet of destination.
- `VIP`: Whether the passenger is a VIP.
- `Name`: Full name of the passenger.
- `Transported`: Target variable (only in training data).

#### 4.1.4 Datetime type
- None.

### 4.2 Detailed data description
The training dataset includes features that provide insights into passengers, such as their home planet, cryosleep status, age, VIP status, cabin information, and spending across various luxury services.

## 5. Target Variable
- **Transported**: A binary variable indicating whether a passenger was transported (True) or not (False), present only in the training dataset.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
Submissions will be evaluated based on **classification accuracy**, measuring the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

## 7. Submission Format
The final submission should be a CSV file with the format:
```
PassengerId,Transported
0013_01,False
0018_01,False
0019_01,False
0021_01,False
...
```

## 8. Other Key Aspects
- **Rolling Leaderboard**: The leaderboard refreshes every two months, invalidating older submissions.
- **Community Engagement**: Participants are encouraged to engage in forums and use Kaggle Notebooks for collaborative analysis.
- **Getting Started**: Designed as a beginner-friendly competition, suitable for those new to data science and machine learning.
