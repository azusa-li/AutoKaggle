# Data Information

## Data Type

### ID type
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each data point, which will NOT be used in model training.

### Numerical type
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `RoomService`: Amount spent on room service.
- `FoodCourt`: Amount spent at the food court.
- `ShoppingMall`: Amount spent at the shopping mall.
- `Spa`: Amount spent at the spa.
- `VRDeck`: Amount spent on the VR deck.
- `RoomService_log`: Log-transformed RoomService.
- `FoodCourt_log`: Log-transformed FoodCourt.
- `ShoppingMall_log`: Log-transformed ShoppingMall.
- `Spa_log`: Log-transformed Spa.
- `VRDeck_log`: Log-transformed VRDeck.

### Categorical type
- `Cabin`: Cabin identifier.
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Transported`: Whether the passenger was transported or not (target variable).
- `RoomService_flag`: Binary flag indicating if RoomService is zero.
- `FoodCourt_flag`: Binary flag indicating if FoodCourt is zero.
- `ShoppingMall_flag`: Binary flag indicating if ShoppingMall is zero.
- `Spa_flag`: Binary flag indicating if Spa is zero.
- `VRDeck_flag`: Binary flag indicating if VRDeck is zero.

### Datetime type
- None

## Detailed data description
The dataset includes various features related to passengers on a space trip. Notable patterns include:
- Binary flags for expenditures indicating if the value is zero.
- Log transformations applied to financial data to handle skewness.
- Age is categorized into groups.
- Cabin information is split into deck, number, and side.
- Binary flags for different home planets, destinations, cryo sleep status, and VIP status are included.

## Target Variable
- `Transported`: This is the target variable indicating whether the passenger was transported (True) or not (False).

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file should include the following columns:
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- `Transported`: Predicted value indicating whether the passenger was transported (True/False).
