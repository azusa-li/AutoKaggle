## PLAN

### STEP 1
Task: Data Preparation
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** for standardization (e.g., `StandardScaler`).
- Involved features: Remove non-numeric columns (`PassengerId`, `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`), standardize numerical features (`Age`, `Fare`, `FarePerPerson`).

Expected output or Impact on data:
- `X_train` and `X_test` datasets with consistent and relevant features.
- `y_train` containing the target variable for training.

Constraints:
- Ensure non-numeric columns are removed.
- Standardization parameters should be consistent across both datasets.

### STEP 2
Task: Model Training and Validation
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model** 
  - Parameters:
    - `X` = `X_train`
    - `y` = `y_train`
    - `problem_type` = `binary`
    - `selected_models` = `["XGBoost", "SVM", "random forest", "decision tree", "logistic regression"]`

Expected output or Impact on data:
- The best performing trained model and its performance metrics.

Constraints:
- Limit to three models due to computational resource constraints.

### STEP 3
Task: Model Prediction
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Scikit-learn** for model prediction.
- Involved features: `X_test`.

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Predictions (`y_test_pred`) for the test dataset.

Constraints:
- Ensure consistency of feature columns between training and test datasets.

### STEP 4
Task: Submission File Preparation
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Pandas** for DataFrame manipulation and CSV export.
- Involved features: `PassengerId` from `processed_test.csv`, `Survived` status from predictions.

Expected output or Impact on data:
- `submission.csv` file ready for submission.

Constraints:
- Ensure the submission file adheres to the required format.
