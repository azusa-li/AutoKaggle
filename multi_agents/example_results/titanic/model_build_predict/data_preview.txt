## Detailed data description
The data provided consists of processed information from the Titanic passenger list. Key features include demographics (Age, Sex), socio-economic status (Pclass, Fare), family structure (SibSp, Parch, FamilySize, IsAlone), ticket information (Ticket, Cabin, Embarked), and engineered features (Title, AgeGroup, FareGroup).

Notable patterns:
- The `Survived` column is the target variable indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- Age and Fare have been standardized.
- Cabin information is missing for many passengers.
- Embarked locations are encoded as `Embarked_C`, `Embarked_Q`, and `Embarked_S`.
- Titles extracted from names provide additional categorical information (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Rare).
- FamilySize and IsAlone are derived from SibSp and Parch.
- Age and Fare have been grouped into categories like AgeGroup and FareGroup, which are also one-hot encoded.

## Target Variable
- Survived: This is the target variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission format required includes:
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
