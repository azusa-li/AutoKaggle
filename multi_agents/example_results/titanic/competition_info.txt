# Competition Information

## 1. Competition Overview
This competition challenges participants to predict survival outcomes from the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques based on passenger data. The objective is to understand which characteristics influenced survival rates.

## 2. Files
- **train.csv**: Contains data for 891 passengers, including survival status (ground truth).
- **test.csv**: Contains data for 418 passengers without survival information; participants must predict the outcomes.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A template demonstrating the required format for submission.

## 3. Problem Definition
Participants need to predict a binary outcome (survival: 1 or non-survival: 0) for passengers based on their characteristics using the training dataset.

## 4. Data Information
### 4.1 Data type
#### 4.1.1 ID type
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.

#### 4.1.2 Numerical type
- **Age**
- **SibSp** (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- **Parch** (Number of parents/children aboard)
- **Fare**

#### 4.1.3 Categorical type
- **Survived** (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass** (Passenger class: 1, 2, 3)
- **Name**
- **Sex**
- **Ticket**
- **Cabin**
- **Embarked** (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

#### 4.1.4 Datetime type
- None

### 4.2 Detailed data description
The dataset includes features such as passenger class, name, sex, age, family relations (SibSp and Parch), ticket number, fare paid, cabin number, and embarkation port. The training data has a mix of passenger demographics, with notable survival patterns, while the test data follows a similar structure but lacks the survival variable.

## 5. Target Variable
The target variable is **Survived**, indicating whether each passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation metric is **accuracy**, which measures the percentage of correct predictions of the survival status in the test set.

## 7. Submission Format
The submission file must contain:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifiers for each passenger (sorted in any order).
- **Survived**: Predicted survival status (0 or 1).

The CSV format should have exactly 418 rows plus a header:
```
PassengerId,Survived
892,0
893,1
894,0
...
```

## 8. Other Key Aspects
- **Data Imputation**: Handle missing values, especially in the age feature.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features for improved model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to identify patterns and insights.
- **Community Resources**: Engage with forums and shared notebooks for learning and collaboration.
