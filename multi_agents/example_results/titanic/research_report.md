# COMPETITION RESEARCH REPORT

## 1. PRELIMINARY EDA
The preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) involved examining the dataset's structure and identifying key features. The analysis revealed critical insights such as:
- **Missing Values**: Notably, the `Age` and `Cabin` features had significant missing values.
- **Outliers**: Outliers were identified in the `Fare` and `Age` features, with fares exceeding 200 and ages above 60.
- **Statistical Summary**: The median age was around 30, while the median fare was approximately 14.45.

**Actions Taken**:
To address the identified issues, strategies for the upcoming data cleaning phase were proposed:
- Impute missing values in `Age` using mean or median.
- Consider dropping or encoding the `Cabin` feature due to high missing values.
- Impute missing values in `Embarked` with the most frequent category.

## 2. DATA CLEANING
The data cleaning phase focused on addressing missing values and outliers. Key actions included:
- **Imputation**:
  - `Age`: Missing values were filled with the mean.
  - `Cabin`: Filled with 'Missing' to indicate absence.
  - `Embarked`: Missing values filled with the mode.
  
- **Outlier Treatment**:
  - `Fare` and `Age` were clipped using the IQR method to reduce the influence of outliers.

**Rationale**:
These actions enhanced data quality and ensured that the dataset was more suitable for modeling, thereby reducing potential biases from missing data and outliers.

## 3. DEEP EDA
In-depth EDA revealed valuable insights about the relationships between features and survival rates:
- **Pclass**: Higher classes showed higher survival rates; average Pclass was 2.31.
- **Sex**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
- **Fare**: Higher fares correlated positively with survival, indicating a potential link to better accommodation and safety.

**Implications**:
These insights guided the feature engineering phase and emphasized the importance of categorical features, particularly `Sex` and `Pclass`, in predicting survival.

## 4. FEATURE ENGINEERING
Feature engineering involved creating and transforming features to enhance model performance:
- **New Features Created**:
  - **Title**: Extracted from `Name`.
  - **FamilySize**: Summation of `SibSp` and `Parch`.
  - **IsAlone**: Binary feature indicating if a passenger traveled alone.
  - **FarePerPerson**: Calculated fare per individual in a family.

- **Categorical Binning**:
  - `Age` and `Fare` were binned into categorical groups for better model interpretation.

**Rationale**:
These transformations aimed to capture complex relationships in the data, making it easier for models to learn patterns associated with survival.

## 5. MODEL BUILDING, VALIDATION, AND PREDICTION
Multiple models were trained during this phase, including:
- **Models**: XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
- **Best Model**: Random Forest achieved the highest validation score of 0.8379.

**Consistency**:
Training and test datasets were aligned through one-hot encoding and removal of non-numeric columns, ensuring that both datasets had a consistent feature structure.

**Limitations**:
- Resource constraints limited the number of models trained.
- Potential overfitting in simpler models like Decision Tree due to lack of complexity considerations.

## 6. CONCLUSION
The competition's approach involved a structured process of EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Key insights included the strong influence of `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Fare` on survival rates. The most impactful decisions involved addressing missing values and outliers, which collectively improved data quality and model accuracy. Future recommendations include further feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and validation of feature importance to enhance model performance.
