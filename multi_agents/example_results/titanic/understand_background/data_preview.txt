## Detailed data description
The dataset consists of two parts: training data and test data. The training data contains 10 samples with features such as passenger class, name, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), number of parents/children aboard (Parch), ticket number, fare paid, cabin number, and embarkation port. The ages vary, with some missing values. Most passengers are male and belong to different passenger classes, with a notable number of survivors (1) and non-survivors (0) in the training set. The fare values exhibit a wide range, indicating varying levels of ticket prices.

The test data also follows a similar structure but lacks the 'Survived' target variable. It contains 10 samples and similarly includes both male and female passengers across different ages and classes. 

Notable patterns in the training data include:
- Higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers.
- Missing age data for certain passengers, which may require imputation or special handling in modeling.

## Target Variable
The target variable is 'Survived', which indicates whether a passenger survived the disaster (1) or not (0). This binary classification is essential for understanding the factors that contributed to survival.
