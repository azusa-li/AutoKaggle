## Detailed Data Description
The dataset provided consists of information related to passengers aboard the Titanic. Below is a detailed description of each feature:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Binary indicator of survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Full name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger in years. Some values are missing.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Passenger fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number. Many values are missing.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

Notable patterns and characteristics:
- **Survival Rate**: There are more non-survivors (0) compared to survivors (1).
- **Class Distribution**: There is a mix of ticket classes, with 1st class being the highest and 3rd class being the lowest.
- **Gender Distribution**: Both male and female passengers are present, with varying survival rates.
- **Age Distribution**: The age feature contains some missing values. The ages range from very young (2 years old) to older adults (62 years old).
- **Fare**: The fare varies considerably, with some passengers paying as little as 7.25 and others as much as 71.2833.

## Target Variable
- **Survived**: This is the target variable representing whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

# Submission format (if applicable)
For any predictive modeling task (e.g., predicting survival on the test dataset), the submission file should include:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger from the test set.
- **Survived**: Predicted survival status (0 or 1).

Example submission format:
```
PassengerId,Survived
892,0
893,1
894,0
895,0
...
```
Note that the "Survived" column should contain the model's predictions for each corresponding "PassengerId" in the test set.
