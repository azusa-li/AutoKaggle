## QUESTIONS
### Question 1
What statistical trends were observed in the numerical features (Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare), and how do these trends relate to the target variable (Survived)?

### Question 2
What relationships were identified between categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Cabin) and the survival rate, and what visualizations were used to illustrate these relationships?

### Question 3
Were any significant correlations found between the numerical features and the target variable? If so, which features demonstrated the strongest correlations?

### Question 4
What feature interactions were explored during the multivariate analysis, and what insights were gained from these interactions regarding survival?

### Question 5
Which features were identified as having high proportions of missing values, and what strategies could be recommended for handling these missing values in feature engineering?

### Question 6
Based on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, what specific feature engineering strategies would you recommend to enhance model performance?
