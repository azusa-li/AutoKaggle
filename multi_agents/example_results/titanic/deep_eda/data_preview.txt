- 'Age' contains some missing values, which might need imputation for analysis.
- 'Fare' indicates the ticket price paid by the passenger, with a wide range of values.
- 'Cabin' has many missing values, indicating that this feature may not be available for many passengers.
- 'Embarked' denotes the port from where the passenger boarded the Titanic, with some missing values.

## Target Variable
