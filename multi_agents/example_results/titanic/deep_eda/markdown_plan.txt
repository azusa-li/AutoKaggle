## PLAN

### STEP 1
Task: Univariate Analysis of Key Features
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Statistical Summary**: Pandas, numerical features (Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare)
- **Distribution Plots**: Matplotlib, Seaborn; histograms (`bins=30`), KDE plots (`shade=True`), box plots
- **Categorical Features Analysis**: Seaborn’s `countplot`, categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Cabin)
- **Survival Rate Analysis**: Pandas, Seaborn; calculate survival rates, bar plots

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Text: Summary statistics
- Plots: Histograms, KDE plots, box plots, bar plots showing distributions and survival rates

Constraints: Limit generated images to a maximum of 10, focus on critical visualizations.

### STEP 2
Task: Bivariate Analysis to Explore Relationships
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Correlation Matrix**: Pandas, Seaborn’s `heatmap` (`annot=True`)
- **Pairwise Plots**: Seaborn’s `pairplot` (`hue='Survived'`)
- **Cross-Tabulation**: Pandas, Seaborn; cross-tabulations, stacked bar plots
- **Box Plots for Numerical-Categorical Interaction**: Seaborn’s `boxplot`

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Text: Correlation matrix
- Plots: Heatmaps, pair plots, stacked bar plots, box plots showing feature interactions

Constraints: Ensure runtime efficiency for large datasets.

### STEP 3
Task: Multivariate Analysis to Identify Feature Interactions
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Multivariate Plots**: Seaborn’s `violinplot`
- **Facet Grid Plots**: Seaborn’s `FacetGrid`
- **Interaction Plots**: Matplotlib, Statsmodels
- **Survival Analysis**: Lifelines library

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Plots: Violin plots, facet grid plots, interaction plots, survival curves

Constraints: Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.

### STEP 4
Task: Summarize Insights and Provide Recommendations for Feature Engineering
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Summary Report**: Compile key insights from univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
- **Recommendations**: Provide specific recommendations for feature engineering based on insights.

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Text: Detailed summary report and recommendations

Constraints: Prioritize textual descriptions and ensure recommendations are actionable.
