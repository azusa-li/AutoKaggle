## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1
What statistical trends were observed in the numerical features (Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare), and how do these trends relate to the target variable (Survived)?
### Answer 1
- **Pclass**: The mean is approximately 2.31, indicating a majority are in lower classes. Survival rates correlate positively with higher classes.
- **Age**: The mean age is around 29.7 years, with younger passengers generally having a higher survival rate.
- **SibSp**: Low average (0.52), suggesting most passengers traveled alone or with one sibling/spouse. Higher numbers correlate negatively with survival.
- **Parch**: Mean of 0.38 indicates most passengers traveled without parents/children. Fewer family members seem to correlate with higher survival.
- **Fare**: Mean fare is approximately 24.05, with higher fares associated with increased survival rates.

### Question 2
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.
### Answer 2
The primary features involved in this phase include:
- **Numerical Features**: Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare. No features were deleted, but they were analyzed for trends and correlations with the target variable.
- **Categorical Features**: Sex, Embarked, Cabin. Analysis focused on survival rates related to these features. No features were modified or created, but insights on missing values and potential new features were noted.

### Question 3
What relationships were identified between categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Cabin) and the survival rate, and what visualizations were used to illustrate these relationships?
### Answer 3
- **Sex**: Clear disparity; females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Embarked**: Passengers from Cherbourg (C) had the highest survival rate, followed by those from Queenstown (Q) and Southampton (S).
- **Cabin**: High proportions of missing values limit analysis, but generally assumed that cabin class may correlate with survival.

**Visualizations Used**:
- Count plots for categorical features.
- Bar plots for survival rates segmented by categorical features.

### Question 4
Were any significant correlations found between the numerical features and the target variable? If so, which features demonstrated the strongest correlations?
### Answer 4
- The correlation matrix revealed:
  - **Fare**: Strong positive correlation with survival (0.26).
  - **Pclass**: Strong negative correlation with survival (-0.34).
  - **Age**: Moderate negative correlation (-0.08), suggesting that while younger passengers had higher survival rates, the relationship isn't very strong.

### Question 5
What feature interactions were explored during the multivariate analysis, and what insights were gained from these interactions regarding survival?
### Answer 5
- Interaction between features such as **Fare and Age** was visualized using scatter plots. Observations suggest that higher fares often corresponded with higher survival rates, especially for younger passengers.
- **Violin plots** illustrated age distributions by survival status, showing that both survivors and non-survivors had similar median ages, but survivors had a wider spread of ages.

### Question 6
Which features were identified as having high proportions of missing values, and what strategies could be recommended for handling these missing values in feature engineering?
### Answer 6
- **Age**: Contains missing values that need imputation; recommended to use median values stratified by Pclass and Sex.
- **Cabin**: High missing values; consider creating a new feature indicating if cabin information is available or not.
- **Embarked**: Some missing values; suggest imputing based on the most frequent port.
