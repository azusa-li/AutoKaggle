    ### Summary of Insights from In-depth EDA ###
    
    1. **Age**:
       - Younger passengers had a higher survival rate.
       - Significant age distribution differences between survivors and non-survivors.
    
    2. **Fare**:
       - Higher ticket fares are associated with higher survival rates.
       - Wide range of fare values across different classes.
    
    3. **Pclass**:
       - Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) had a significantly higher survival rate.
    
    4. **Sex**:
       - Female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to males.
    
    5. **Embarked**:
       - Passengers embarked from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate.
    
    ### Recommendations for Feature Engineering ###
    
    1. **Imputation**: 
       - Impute missing values for 'Age' using median values stratified by 'Pclass' and 'Sex'.
       - Consider imputing 'Embarked' based on the most frequent port.
    
    2. **Feature Scaling**:
       - Normalize or standardize 'Fare' to handle wide range of values.
    
    3. **Encoding**:
       - Encode categorical features like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' using one-hot encoding.
    
    4. **Feature Interaction**:
       - Create interaction features such as 'Pclass*Age' and 'FamilySize' (SibSp + Parch).
    
    5. **New Features**:
       - Extract titles from 'Name' and create a new 'Title' feature.
       - Create a 'CabinKnown' feature indicating whether cabin information is present.
