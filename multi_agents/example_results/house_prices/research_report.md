# COMPETITION RESEARCH REPORT

## 1. PRELIMINARY EDA
In the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we processed the training and testing datasets, revealing a total of 81 features in the training data and 80 in the testing data. Key insights included identifying numerical and categorical features, the presence of missing values (e.g., LotFrontage: 330 missing values, 22.6%), and outliers in features like LotArea. 

Actions taken included generating histograms, box plots, and bar plots for a visual understanding of feature distributions. We prioritized cleaning tasks based on missing values, outliers, and categorical imbalances, setting the stage for more refined data cleaning.

## 2. DATA CLEANING
During the data cleaning phase, we focused on addressing missing values and outliers. Missing values in numerical features were imputed with medians, while categorical features received the label 'Missing.' Notably, the 'FireplaceQu' feature was removed since it was absent in the test dataset. Outliers were capped using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, especially for features like LotArea and GrLivArea.

This phase ensured a more uniform dataset, preparing it for deeper analysis and feature engineering without the influence of excessive missing data or outliers.

## 3. DEEP EDA
In-depth analysis revealed significant insights, particularly regarding the correlation of features with the target variable, SalePrice. For instance, OverallQual had a strong positive correlation (0.79) with SalePrice, while GrLivArea followed at 0.71. Visualizations, including scatter plots and correlation matrices, effectively conveyed these relationships.

Bivariate analysis of categorical features indicated that neighborhoods like 'NridgHt' commanded higher prices, guiding us on which categorical features might require more attention in modeling. These findings highlighted the importance of size and quality features in the predictive modeling process.

## 4. FEATURE ENGINEERING
We created several new features during this phase to enhance our dataset:
- **HouseAge**: `YrSold - YearBuilt`
- **YearsSinceRemod**: `YrSold - YearRemodAdd`
- **TotalBath**: Combination of bath counts
- **TotalPorchSF**: Aggregate of porch areas
- **TotalSF**: Sum of various floor areas
- **OverallQual_SF**: Interaction between OverallQual and GrLivArea

Log transformations were applied to features like LotArea and SalePrice to reduce skewness. Categorical features were encoded using one-hot and label encoding methods, ensuring they were ready for inclusion in modeling. 

## 5. MODEL BUILDING, VALIDATION, AND PREDICTION
We selected and trained three models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The Gradient Boosting Regressor yielded the best performance with an RMSE of 0.1325, outperforming the other models. 

Cross-validation metrics indicated the robustness of our models, emphasizing the importance of feature selection and transformation in achieving accurate predictions. 

## 6. CONCLUSION
Overall, our approach involved methodical exploration and cleaning of the dataset, leading to insightful feature engineering and robust model development. Key insights included the strong influence of OverallQual and GrLivArea on SalePrice, guiding our feature prioritization.

The decisions to remove problematic features, impute missing values, and create interaction features were pivotal in enhancing model performance. Future competitions could benefit from exploring advanced models and conducting deeper analysis on feature importance.
