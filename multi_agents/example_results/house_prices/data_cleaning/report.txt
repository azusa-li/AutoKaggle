## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.
### Answer 1
The following files were processed:
- **Input Files**:
  - Train dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/train.csv`
  - Test dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/test.csv`

- **Generated Files**:
  - Cleaned train dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv`
  - Cleaned test dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv`

### Question 2
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features were deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. 
### Answer 2
- **Involved Features**:
  - **Numerical Features**: LotFrontage, MasVnrArea, GarageYrBlt, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, GarageCars, GarageArea.
  - **Categorical Features**: Alley, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinType2, Electrical, GarageType, GarageFinish, GarageQual, GarageCond, MSZoning, Utilities, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, KitchenQual, Functional, SaleType.

- **Changes**:
  - Missing values in numerical features were imputed with the **median**.
  - Missing values in categorical features were filled with the string **'Missing'**.
  - Outliers in LotArea, GrLivArea, and TotalBsmtSF were capped using the **IQR** method.
  - The feature **'FireplaceQu'** was deleted from the training dataset as it was not present in the test dataset.

### Question 3
What discrepancies or inconsistencies were found between the training and test datasets, and how were they resolved?
### Answer 3
A discrepancy was found with the feature **'FireplaceQu'**, which was present in the training dataset but absent in the test dataset. To resolve this inconsistency, the feature **'FireplaceQu'** was removed from the training dataset to ensure uniformity between the two datasets.

### Question 4
Were any features removed or created during the data cleaning process? If so, what were the reasons for these changes?
### Answer 4
- **Removed Features**: 
  - Columns with more than **50%** missing values were removed (specific columns were not detailed in the code).
  - The feature **'FireplaceQu'** was removed from the training dataset due to its absence in the test dataset.

- **No new features** were created during this phase.

### Question 5
What transformations were applied to the data types of any features, and how do they align with the intended analysis for the next phase?
### Answer 5
- **Transformations Applied**:
  - Numerical columns were converted to **float** type.
  - Categorical columns were converted to **string** type.

- **Alignment with Next Phase**: 
  These transformations ensure that the data types are appropriate for modeling in the next phase, facilitating the application of machine learning algorithms that require numerical inputs and categorical features in string format.

### Question 6
What are the key findings or patterns observed during the data cleaning process that should be further investigated in the exploratory analysis?
### Answer 6
- **Key Findings**:
  - There were significant missing values in both numerical and categorical columns, indicating areas for further investigation regarding their impact on house prices.
  - The handling of outliers suggests that certain features may have a significant range of values that could influence the model's performance.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Analyzing the distribution of missing values and their relationships with other features could provide insights into whether certain variables predict missingness.
  - Exploring the attributes of the outliers may reveal specific characteristics of unique properties valuable for feature engineering.
