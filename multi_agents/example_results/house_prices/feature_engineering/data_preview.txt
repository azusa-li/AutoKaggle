## Detailed data description

The dataset contains information about house sales in a particular region. The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:

- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.
- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.
- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.

Notable patterns:
- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.
- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.

## Target Variable
- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file should include the following columns:
- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.
- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.

The file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.
