## Detailed data description
The dataset comprises various features related to house attributes and their corresponding sale prices. The features span across different categories including numerical, categorical, and identifiers. Key observations include:

- **Identifiers**: Each house is uniquely identified by the feature `Id`.
- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements like `LotFrontage`, `LotArea`, and `GrLivArea`, as well as counts like `BedroomAbvGr` and `GarageCars`. These features are likely to be continuous variables.
- **Categorical Features**: These features include categories such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `LotShape`, etc. These represent non-numeric data that categorizes houses based on different attributes.
- **Target Variable**: The target variable `SalePrice` represents the house prices and is only available in the training dataset.

Notable patterns:
- The `OverallQual` and `OverallCond` features likely represent overall quality and condition ratings on a scale.
- `YearBuilt` and `YearRemodAdd` indicate the year the house was built and the year it was remodeled, respectively.
- Features like `GarageType`, `GarageFinish`, `GarageQual`, and `GarageCond` provide detailed information about garages.

## Target Variable
- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable for the training dataset. It represents the sale price of the houses.

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file should include the following columns:
- Id (integer): Unique identifier for each house.
- SalePrice (float): Predicted sale price for each house.

Example:
```
Id,SalePrice
1461,200000
1462,181500
1463,223500
