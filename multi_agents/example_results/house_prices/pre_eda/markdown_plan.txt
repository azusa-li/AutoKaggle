## PLAN

### STEP 1
**Task:** Data Structure and Summary
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - Load datasets using `pandas.read_csv`
  - Inspect data with `df.head()`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()`
  - Use `df.describe(include=['O'])` for categorical features
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - Basic understanding of data structure
  - Summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numerical features
  - Frequency counts for categorical features
- **Constraints:**
  - Analyze both training and testing datasets separately

### STEP 2
**Task:** Missing Values Analysis
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - Calculate missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`
  - Calculate percentage of missing values relative to total rows
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - List of features with missing values and their corresponding count and percentage of missingness
- **Constraints:**
  - Focus on both training and testing datasets

### STEP 3
**Task:** Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - Visualize distributions with histograms using `sns.histplot` or `plt.hist`
  - Identify outliers with box plots using `sns.boxplot`
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - Histograms and box plots for numerical features with insights into their distributions and any potential outliers
- **Constraints:**
  - Limit the number of generated images to a maximum of 10 critical visualizations
  - Prioritize features likely to influence the target variable `SalePrice`

### STEP 4
**Task:** Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - Visualize frequency distributions with bar plots using `sns.countplot`
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - Bar plots for categorical features showing the frequency distribution of categories
- **Constraints:**
  - Limit the number of generated images to a maximum of 10 critical visualizations
  - Highlight any categorical features with imbalances or unusual patterns
