## PLAN

### STEP 1
**Task:** Univariate Analysis of Key Features
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - `pandas.describe()` for summary statistics.
  - `seaborn.histplot()` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualizing distributions.
  - Numerical features: `SalePrice`, `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`.
  - `pandas.value_counts()` for analyzing categorical features.
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - Text summary of numerical feature statistics.
  - Histograms for key numerical features.
  - Frequency counts for categorical features.
- **Constraints:**
  - Limit to key numerical features that are likely to impact `SalePrice`.
  - Maximize efficiency by plotting multiple histograms in a grid layout.
  - Print top categories for features with high cardinality.

### STEP 2
**Task:** Bivariate Analysis with Target Variable
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - `pandas.corr()` and `seaborn.heatmap()` for correlation analysis.
  - Numerical features: All numerical features along with `SalePrice`.
  - `seaborn.scatterplot()` for scatter plots.
  - Features: `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `LotArea`, `OverallQual`.
  - `seaborn.boxplot()` for box plots.
  - Features: `Neighborhood`, `BldgType`, `HouseStyle`, `OverallQual`.
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - Correlation matrix and heatmap.
  - Scatter plots for significant numerical features.
  - Box plots for key categorical features.
- **Constraints:**
  - Focus on features with high correlation to `SalePrice`.
  - Limit scatter plots to features with significant correlation.
  - Prioritize features with high cardinality and diverse categories.

### STEP 3
**Task:** Feature Interactions
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - `seaborn.pairplot()` for pairwise scatter plots.
  - Features: `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, `SalePrice`.
  - `pandas.groupby()`, `pandas.agg()` for interaction analysis.
  - Features: `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, `Neighborhood`, `SalePrice`.
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - Pairwise scatter plots matrix.
  - Text summary of interaction analysis results.
- **Constraints:**
  - Select a subset of features to avoid overly complex visualizations.
  - Focus on combinations likely to show significant interactions.

### STEP 4
**Task:** Visualizing Key Insights and Patterns
- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn.barplot()` for important feature visualizations.
  - Features: Features with the highest impact on `SalePrice`.
  - Text summary for recommendations.
  - Insights from all analyzed features.
- **Expected output or Impact on data:**
  - Visualizations of key insights.
  - Detailed text summary with actionable recommendations for feature engineering.
- **Constraints:**
  - Limit the number of visualizations to the most impactful insights.
  - Ensure recommendations are specific and actionable.
