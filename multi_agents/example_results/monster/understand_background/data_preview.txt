### Numerical type
- `bone_length`
- `rotting_flesh`
- `hair_length`
- `has_soul`

### Categorical type

## Detailed data description
The dataset consists of both training and testing data. The training data has 6 features plus a target variable, while the testing data contains only features. 

- **Training Data**:
  - Contains 20 entries with various values for `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, and `has_soul`, which appear to be numerical measurements.
  - The `color` feature includes categories like 'clear', 'green', 'black', 'white', and 'blue'.
  - The `type` feature, which is the target variable, includes categories such as 'Ghoul', 'Goblin', and 'Ghost'. 

- **Testing Data**:
  - Contains 10 entries with the same features as the training data except for the `type` variable.

Notable patterns include:
- The `type` variable is likely influenced by the values of the numerical features.
- There appears to be a range of values for each numerical feature, indicating possible variability in the characteristics of each entity. 

## Target Variable
- **Target Variable**: `type`
- **Description**: This variable classifies entities into categories such as 'Ghoul', 'Goblin', and 'Ghost' based on the measurements of the other features.

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file for predictions should include the following columns:
