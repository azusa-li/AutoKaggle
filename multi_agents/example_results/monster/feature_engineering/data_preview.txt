## Detailed data description
The dataset consists of both training and testing data related to different creature types. 

- **ID**: Each data point is uniquely identified by the `id` column.
  
- **Numerical Features**:
  - `bone_length`: Ranges approximately between 0.28 to 0.78, indicating variability in bone length among creatures.
  - `rotting_flesh`: Values range from about 0.14 to 0.88, suggesting varying levels of flesh decomposition.
  - `hair_length`: Varies between approximately 0.17 to 0.81, showing differences in hair length.
  - `has_soul`: Values range from 0.10 to 0.88, representing the presence or absence of a soul on a scale.
  
- **Categorical Feature**:
  - `color`: Includes categories such as 'black', 'green', 'clear', 'white', and 'blue', reflecting the color diversity among creatures.

Notable patterns include:
- **Ghoul**: Typically associated with higher `has_soul` values and colors like 'clear' and 'black'.
- **Goblin**: Often linked with 'green', 'white', and 'black' colors and varying `has_soul` values.
- **Ghost**: Generally associated with 'green', 'blue', 'clear', and 'white' colors with lower `has_soul` values.

The distribution of numerical features shows a wide range, indicating diversity in physical and metaphysical attributes among different creature types.

## Target Variable
- **`type`**: This is the target variable representing the category of each creature. The possible classes are:
  - `Ghoul`
  - `Goblin`
  - `Ghost`

The goal is to predict the `type` of a creature based on its physical and metaphysical attributes.

# Submission format
The submission file should be in CSV format containing the following columns:

- `id` (Integer): Unique identifier for each test data point.
- `type` (String): Predicted class label for each creature (`Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`).

**Example:**
```csv
id,type
3,Ghoul
6,Goblin
9,Ghost
...
```
