## Detailed data description
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. 

**Training Data:**
- **Features:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each data point.
  - `bone_length`: Numerical value representing the length of bones.
  - `rotting_flesh`: Numerical value indicating the extent of flesh rotting.
  - `hair_length`: Numerical value representing the length of hair.
  - `has_soul`: Numerical value indicating the presence of a soul.
  - `color`: Categorical value describing the color attribute.
- **Target Variable:**
  - `type`: Categorical variable with possible classes such as "Ghoul", "Goblin", and "Ghost".

**Testing Data:**
- Contains the same features as the training data except for the `type` column, which needs to be predicted.

**Notable Patterns and Characteristics:**
- **Numerical Features:**
  - Values range between approximately 0.1 and 0.88.
  - There may be correlations between `has_soul` and other numerical features like `rotting_flesh` or `bone_length`.
- **Categorical Features:**
  - `color` includes categories like "clear", "green", "black", "white", and "blue".
  - Certain `type` classes may be associated with specific `color` categories (e.g., "Ghoul" often has "clear" or "black" color).
  
## Target Variable
- **`type`**: This is the target variable that represents the classification category of each entity. The possible classes include:
  - **Ghoul**
  - **Goblin**
  - **Ghost**

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file should be in CSV format containing the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each test data point.
- `type`: Predicted class for each test data point. The value should be one of the predefined categories ("Ghoul", "Goblin", "Ghost").

Example:
```csv
id,type
3,Ghoul
6,Goblin
9,Ghost
...
```
