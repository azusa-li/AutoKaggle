## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  
### Question 1
What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.
### Answer 1
The following files were processed:
- **Training Data:** `train.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/train.csv`
- **Testing Data:** `test.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/test.csv`

No new files were generated during this phase.

### Question 2
Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.
### Answer 2
The following features were involved in this phase:
- **Training Data Features:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (int64)
  - `bone_length`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `rotting_flesh`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `hair_length`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `has_soul`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `color`: Categorical feature (object)
  - `type`: Target variable (object)

- **Testing Data Features:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (int64)
  - `bone_length`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `rotting_flesh`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `hair_length`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `has_soul`: Numerical feature (float64)
  - `color`: Categorical feature (object)

No features were modified, deleted, or created during this phase.

### Question 3
Which features have missing values, and what is the extent (number and percentage) of these missing values?
### Answer 3
There were no missing values detected in either the training or testing datasets. All features are complete with no missing entries.

### Question 4
Were any outliers detected in the numerical features, and if so, which features are they associated with?
### Answer 4
Outliers were detected in numerical features using the IQR method. However, specific counts of outliers for each feature were not provided. The features evaluated for outliers include:
- `bone_length`
- `rotting_flesh`
- `hair_length`
- `has_soul`

### Question 5
What were the unique values identified in the categorical features, and do any inconsistencies or unexpected values exist?
### Answer 5
**Unique Values in Categorical Features:**
- **Training Data:**
  - `color`: 6 unique values -> ['clear', 'green', 'black', 'white', 'blue', 'blood']
  - `type`: 3 unique values -> ['Ghoul', 'Goblin', 'Ghost']

- **Testing Data:**
  - `color`: 6 unique values -> ['black', 'white', 'blue', 'clear', 'green', 'blood']

No inconsistencies or unexpected values were found in the categorical features.

### Question 6
Based on the exploratory analysis, what specific data cleaning actions are recommended for the next phase to enhance data quality?
### Answer 6
1. **Outlier Handling:** Investigate detected outliers further to determine if they should be removed or treated.
2. **Consistency Checks:** Verify that all color categories are consistent across both datasets.
3. **Documentation:** Document any assumptions made during the analysis, especially regarding correlations.
4. **Duplicate Checks:** Confirm that no duplicate entries exist, as indicated in the output.
5. **Prepare for Feature Engineering:** Consider the relationships highlighted in the correlation analysis for potential feature interactions or transformations.

These actions will help ensure that the data is clean and ready for the next steps in analysis.
