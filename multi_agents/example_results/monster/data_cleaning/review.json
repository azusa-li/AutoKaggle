Implement a logging mechanism to track changes made during categorical standardization for better traceability. 3. Ensure that the functions 'detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr', 'convert_data_types', and 'remove_duplicates' are defined or imported to avoid runtime errors.",

Ensure that the plan includes specific methods for verifying the effectiveness of outlier handling, such as visualizing the data distributions before and after cleaning. 2. Include a step for documenting the rationale behind any changes or decisions made during the data cleaning process to enhance clarity and understanding for future reference."
