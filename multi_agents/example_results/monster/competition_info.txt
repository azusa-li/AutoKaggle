# Competition Information
## 1. Competition Overview
The "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!" competition challenges participants to classify 900 creatures into three categories: Ghoul, Goblin, and Ghost, using machine learning techniques based on various features.

## 2. Files
- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing features and the target variable (`type`).
- **test.csv**: The test dataset containing only features, without the target variable.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A template for the correct submission format.

## 3. Problem Definition
The objective is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the type of creature based on provided features, evaluated by the accuracy of classification.

## 4. Data Information
### 4.1 Data type
#### 4.1.1 ID type
- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point (not used in training).

#### 4.1.2 Numerical type
- `bone_length`: Average length of bone (normalized between 0 and 1).
- `rotting_flesh`: Percentage of rotting flesh.
- `hair_length`: Average hair length (normalized between 0 and 1).
- `has_soul`: Percentage of soul in the creature.

#### 4.1.3 Categorical type
- `color`: Dominant color (options: 'white', 'black', 'clear', 'blue', 'green', 'blood').
- `type`: The target variable (only in training data; options: 'Ghost', 'Goblin', 'Ghoul').

#### 4.1.4 Datetime type
- None.

### 4.2 Detailed data description
- **Training Data**: 20 entries with numerical and categorical features, including measurements and the target variable.
- **Testing Data**: 10 entries with the same features as the training data but without the target variable.

## 5. Target Variable
- **Target Variable**: `type`
- **Description**: Classifies the creature into one of three categories: 'Ghoul', 'Goblin', 'Ghost'.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
Submissions are evaluated based on categorization accuracy, specifically the percentage of correctly classified creatures.

## 7. Submission Format
The submission file must include:
- **Columns**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (int).
  - `type`: Predicted class of the entity (categorical).

## 8. Other Key Aspects
- Explore relationships between numerical features and the target variable.
- Investigate interactions between categorical variables and numerical features.
- Consider normalization and feature scaling to enhance model performance.
- Look into potential feature engineering opportunities to improve predictive accuracy.
