# Data Information
## Data Type
### ID type
- `id`

### Numerical type
- `bone_length`
- `rotting_flesh`
- `hair_length`
- `has_soul`

### Categorical type
- `color`

### Datetime type
- *None*

## Detailed data description
The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets. 

- **Training Data**: Consists of 10 records with the following features:
  - **`id`**: Unique identifier for each creature.
  - **`bone_length`**: Numerical measurement representing the length of the creature's bones.
  - **`rotting_flesh`**: Numerical value indicating the extent of flesh decomposition.
  - **`hair_length`**: Numerical measurement of hair length.
  - **`has_soul`**: Numerical indicator (likely between 0 and 1) denoting the presence of a soul.
  - **`color`**: Categorical feature describing the color of the creature (e.g., clear, green, black, white, blue).
  - **`type`**: Categorical target variable representing the creature type (e.g., Ghoul, Goblin, Ghost).

- **Testing Data**: Consists of 10 records with the same features as the training data, excluding the target variable `type`.

### Notable Patterns and Characteristics:
- **Color Distribution**: Multiple color categories such as clear, green, black, white, and blue are present, suggesting variability in creature appearances.
- **Type Distribution**: The target variable includes at least three categories—Ghoul, Goblin, and Ghost—each potentially associated with distinct feature patterns.
- **Feature Ranges**:
  - `bone_length` ranges approximately between 0.28 to 0.78.
  - `rotting_flesh` varies from around 0.14 to 0.88.
  - `hair_length` spans from approximately 0.17 to 0.81.
  - `has_soul` values range from about 0.10 to 0.88, possibly indicating different states of being.

## Target Variable
- **`type`**
  - **Description**: The target variable represents the classification of each creature into categories such as Ghoul, Goblin, and Ghost. It is a categorical feature used to train the classification model.

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file should be in CSV format with the following columns:

- `id` (integer): Unique identifier for each test data point.
- `type` (string): Predicted creature type corresponding to each `id`.

**Example:**
| id  | type   |
|-----|--------|
| 3   | Ghoul  |
| 6   | Goblin |
| 9   | Ghost  |
| ... | ...    |
