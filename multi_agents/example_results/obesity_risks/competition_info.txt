# Competition Information
## 1. Competition Overview
The "obesity_risks" competition is part of the Kaggle Playground Series, focusing on multi-class prediction of obesity risk factors related to cardiovascular disease. Participants aim to predict weight status categories for individuals based on various demographic and lifestyle factors.

## 2. Files
- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing features and the categorical target variable `NObeyesdad`.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset with the same features as the training set but without the target variable, used for making predictions.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A file demonstrating the correct format for submissions, showing how to organize predictions.

## 3. Problem Definition
Participants are tasked with predicting the obesity risk classification (`NObeyesdad`) for individuals based on their demographics and lifestyle features.

## 4. Data Information
### 4.1 Data type
#### 4.1.1 ID type
- `id`: Unique identifier for each record (not used in model training).

#### 4.1.2 Numerical type
- `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `CH2O`, `SCC`, `FAF`, `TUE`, `CALC`.

#### 4.1.3 Categorical type
- `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `MTRANS`, `NObeyesdad` (target variable).

#### 4.1.4 Datetime type
- None.

### 4.2 Detailed data description
The dataset includes features reflecting individuals' demographics and lifestyle habits, such as gender, age, height, weight, family history of overweight, dietary habits, physical activity, hydration, and caloric intake.

## 5. Target Variable
- **NObeyesdad**: Categorizes individuals into weight status classes, including Normal_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, Obesity_Type_III, and Insufficient_Weight.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
Submissions are evaluated based on the **accuracy score**, measuring the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.

## 7. Submission Format
The submission file must include:
- `id`: Identifier for each record from the test set.
- `NObeyesdad`: The predicted weight status category.
  
Example format:
```
id,NObeyesdad
20758,Normal_Weight
20759,Normal_Weight
...
```

## 8. Other Key Aspects
- The dataset is synthetically generated, closely resembling real-world data while keeping test labels confidential. 
- The competition encourages visualizations, clustering, and exploratory data analysis, making it suitable for enhancing data science skills.
- With a significant number of participants, competitive benchmarking can provide valuable insights into model performance and feature importance.
