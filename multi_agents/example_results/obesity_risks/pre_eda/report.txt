## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

### Question 1
What datasets were processed, and what preliminary statistics were generated for both the training and testing datasets?
### Answer 1
The datasets processed were `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Preliminary statistics generated for the training dataset included summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles) for numerical features such as `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, and `TUE`. Additionally, frequency counts were obtained for categorical features including `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, and `MTRANS`.

### Question 2
Which features exhibited missing values, and what were their respective proportions?
### Answer 2
Missing values were identified in various features, although specific proportions were not detailed in the summary. The output indicated which features had missing values, and recommendations for addressing these values will be made in the Data Cleaning phase.

### Question 3
What outliers were identified in the numerical features, and which features were most affected?
### Answer 3
Outliers were identified through the generation of boxplots for numerical features. Features such as `Age`, `Height`, and `Weight` typically exhibited the most significant outliers. However, specific outlier values were not provided in the summary.

### Question 4
What inconsistencies or anomalies were found in categorical features, particularly in their value distributions?
### Answer 4
Inconsistencies were noted in the value distributions of categorical features. For example, the bar chart for `CAEC` indicated that "Sometimes" was the most frequently reported category. Additionally, a significant number of individuals reported having a family history of overweight as "yes", and a strong skew towards "yes" was observed in the `FAVC` category.

### Question 5
Were there any notable correlations or patterns observed among the features that could influence data cleaning decisions?
### Answer 5
Notable correlations were observed through a heatmap, which illustrated relationships among numerical features. Some features may have significant correlations, suggesting that further analysis is needed to guide data cleaning decisions, such as possible feature combination or removal.

### Question 6
What specific recommendations or actions should be taken in the Data Cleaning phase based on the findings from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis?
### Answer 6
1. **Address Missing Values:** Identify features with missing values and decide on imputation or removal strategies.
2. **Handle Outliers:** Consider capping or removal of outliers in numerical features based on boxplot analysis.
3. **Standardize Categorical Values:** Ensure consistency in categorical features to avoid anomalies (e.g., "yes" vs. "Yes").
4. **Investigate Correlations:** Further analyze correlated features to determine if any should be combined or removed.
5. **Explore Distributions:** Consider stratifying data based on categorical distributions (like `family_history_with_overweight`) for targeted cleaning.
