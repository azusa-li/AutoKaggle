## Detailed data description
The dataset provided includes both training and testing data, with a total of 18 features and one target variable (`NObeyesdad`). Below is a description of the features:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each data point.
- **Gender**: Categorical feature indicating the gender of the individual (Male or Female).
- **Age**: Numerical feature representing the age of the individual.
- **Height**: Numerical feature representing the height of the individual in meters.
- **Weight**: Numerical feature representing the weight of the individual in kilograms.
- **family_history_with_overweight**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual has a family history of being overweight (yes or no).
- **FAVC**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual frequently consumes high-calorie food (yes or no).
- **FCVC**: Numerical feature representing the frequency of vegetable consumption.
- **NCP**: Numerical feature indicating the number of main meals.
- **CAEC**: Categorical feature representing the frequency of food consumption between meals (Always, Frequently, Sometimes, or no).
- **SMOKE**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual smokes (yes or no).
- **CH2O**: Numerical feature representing the daily water intake in liters.
- **SCC**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual monitors their calorie intake (yes or no).
- **FAF**: Numerical feature representing the frequency of physical activity per week.
- **TUE**: Numerical feature indicating the time spent using technology devices per day.
- **CALC**: Categorical feature indicating the frequency of alcohol consumption (Always, Frequently, Sometimes, or no).
- **MTRANS**: Categorical feature representing the main mode of transportation (Automobile, Public_Transportation, etc.).

### Notable Patterns and Characteristics
- Most individuals have a family history of being overweight and frequently consume high-calorie food.
- The frequency of vegetable consumption (FCVC) and the number of main meals (NCP) vary among individuals.
- The majority of individuals do not smoke and do not monitor their calorie intake.
- The frequency of physical activity (FAF) and time spent using technology (TUE) show significant variation.
- Public transportation is the most common mode of transportation.

## Target Variable
- **NObeyesdad**: This is a categorical target variable indicating the obesity level of the individual. It includes categories such as Insufficient_Weight, Normal_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III.

# Submission format (if applicable)
For submission, the file should include the following columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each data point.
- **NObeyesdad**: Predicted obesity level for each individual.

Each column should retain its original data type, with `id` being an integer and `NObeyesdad` being a categorical string.
