## PLAN

### STEP 1
**Task:** Load and Inspect the Data

**Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
- Tools: Pandas (`read_csv`, `head`, `info`)
- Involved Features: All features in both `train.csv` and `test.csv`

**Expected output or Impact on data:**
- Display of the first few rows of the train and test datasets
- Summary information including data types and non-null counts

**Constraints:**
- Ensure the datasets are loaded correctly and are in a DataFrame format

### STEP 2
**Task:** Basic Statistical Analysis

**Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
- Tools: Pandas (`describe`, `value_counts`)
- Involved Features:
  - Numerical: `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`
  - Categorical: `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS`

**Expected output or Impact on data:**
- Summary statistics for numerical features
- Frequency distribution for categorical features

**Constraints:**
- Ensure all statistics are printed in a clear and understandable format

### STEP 3
**Task:** Identify Missing Values and Inconsistencies

**Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
- Tools: Pandas (`isnull`, `sum`), Matplotlib/Seaborn (boxplots)
- Involved Features: All features

**Expected output or Impact on data:**
- List of features with missing values and their counts
- Boxplots for numerical features to identify potential outliers

**Constraints:**
- Ensure the process is efficient and does not generate excessive output

### STEP 4
**Task:** Initial Data Visualization

**Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**
- Tools: Matplotlib/Seaborn (histograms, bar charts, pairplot, heatmap)
- Involved Features: All features

**Expected output or Impact on data:**
- Histograms for numerical features
- Bar charts for categorical features
- Pairplot for key numerical features
- Heatmap showing correlations between numerical features

**Constraints:**
- Limit the number of plots to a maximum of 10
- Ensure plots are clear and provide valuable insights
