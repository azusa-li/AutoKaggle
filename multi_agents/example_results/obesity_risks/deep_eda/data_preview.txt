## Detailed data description
The provided data consists of various features related to individuals' demographic information, lifestyle habits, and physical attributes. Here are some notable patterns and characteristics:

- The `Gender` feature is binary (male, female).
- The `family_history_with_overweight` feature indicates whether there is a family history of being overweight.
- `FAVC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, and `CALC` are binary indicators (yes, no) of specific lifestyle choices or behaviors.
- `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, and `TUE` are numerical features representing the frequency or quantity of certain behaviors or attributes.
- `CAEC` and `MTRANS` are categorical features representing the frequency of consumption of food between meals and the mode of transportation used, respectively.
- The target variable `NObeyesdad` represents different levels of obesity and weight status: Normal_Weight, Insufficient_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III.

## Target Variable
- `NObeyesdad`: This is the target variable indicating the obesity level of individuals. It includes categories such as Normal_Weight, Insufficient_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III.

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file should include predictions for the target variable `NObeyesdad` for each data point in the test dataset. The required columns are:
- `id` (unique identifier for each data point)
- `NObeyesdad` (predicted obesity level)

Example format:
```csv
id,NObeyesdad
20758,Obesity_Type_II
20759,Normal_Weight
20760,Obesity_Type_III
...
