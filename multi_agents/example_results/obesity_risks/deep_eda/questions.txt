## QUESTIONS
### Question 1
What statistical characteristics were observed for each numerical feature, and how might these influence feature engineering decisions?

### Question 2
What are the relationships between categorical features and the target variable (`NObeyesdad`), and which features show the strongest associations?

### Question 3
What correlations were found among the numerical features and the target variable, and how can these correlations guide the creation of new features?

### Question 4
What interactions between features (both numerical and categorical) were identified, and how can these interactions be leveraged in feature engineering?

### Question 5
What were the results of the chi-square tests for categorical features in relation to the target variable, and which features were found to be significantly dependent?

### Question 6
What key insights and patterns emerged from the visualizations, and how can these insights shape the feature engineering strategy?
