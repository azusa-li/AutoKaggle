## Detailed data description
The dataset contains information related to individuals' demographics, lifestyle behaviors, and health indicators. The notable features include:
- **Gender**: Categorical, indicating whether the individual is male or female.
- **Age**: Numerical, representing the age of the individual in a normalized form.
- **Height and Weight**: Numerical, representing the physical dimensions of the individual in normalized forms.
- **BMI**: Numerical, derived from height and weight, indicating the body mass index in a normalized form.
- **Lifestyle habits**: Including frequency of vegetable consumption (`FCVC`), number of main meals (`NCP`), daily water intake (`CH2O`), physical activity frequency (`FAF`), and time using technology (`TUE`).
- **Behavioral factors**: Such as family history with overweight, consumption of high caloric food (`FAVC`), smoking status (`SMOKE`), alcohol consumption (`CALC`), and mode of transportation (`MTRANS`).
- **Health monitoring**: Whether the individual monitors their caloric intake (`SCC`).

The dataset has been pre-processed with numerical features normalized and categorical features encoded into binary dummy variables. Interaction terms between certain lifestyle factors are also included.

## Target Variable
- `NObeyesdad`: The target variable representing different levels of obesity, including categories such as `Insufficient_Weight`, `Normal_Weight`, `Overweight_Level_I`, `Overweight_Level_II`, `Obesity_Type_I`, `Obesity_Type_II`, and `Obesity_Type_III`.

# Submission format (if applicable)
The submission file should contain the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each test data point.
- `NObeyesdad`: The predicted obesity level for the corresponding id.
