### Question 2
What were the cross-validation accuracy scores for the models, and how did they compare?

### Question 3
What were the key performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, classification report) for the selected model, and what insights can be drawn from them?

### Question 4
Were there any significant issues or challenges encountered during model training or validation, such as overfitting or underfitting?

### Question 5
What features had the most influence on the model's predictions, and how can this information be used in future analyses?
