## Detailed data description
The dataset comprises two parts: training data and test data. The training data includes 10 records with various features related to individuals' demographics and lifestyle that may influence their weight status. The features include:

- **Gender**: Indicates whether the individual is Male or Female.

- **CAEC**: Consumption of food between meals.
- **SMOKE**: Indicates if the individual smokes (yes/no).
- **CH2O**: Daily water consumption in liters.
- **SCC**: Self-calculated cholesterol.
- **FAF**: Physical activity frequency.

- **CALC**: Caloric intake.
- **MTRANS**: Mode of transportation.

The target variable, `NObeyesdad`, categorizes individuals into different weight status levels, such as "Normal_Weight," "Overweight_Level_I," "Overweight_Level_II," "Obesity_Type_II," and "Obesity_Type_III."

The test data includes 10 records with the same features but does not contain the target variable.
