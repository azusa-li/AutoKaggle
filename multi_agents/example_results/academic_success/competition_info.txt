# Competition Information
## 1. Competition Overview
The competition is part of the Kaggle Playground Series, aimed at predicting the academic risk of students in higher education. Participants will classify students into categories of dropout, enrolled, and graduate, with accuracy as the evaluation metric.

## 2. Files
- **train.csv**: Training dataset containing the `Target` variable for model training.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset without the `Target` variable for which predictions must be made.
- **sample_submission.csv**: Template file demonstrating the required format for submissions.

## 3. Problem Definition
The objective is to classify students based on their academic risk using various features from the dataset.

## 4. Data Information
### 4.1 Data type
#### 4.1.1 ID type
- `id`: Unique identifier for each student (not used in model training).

#### 4.1.2 Numerical type
- `Previous qualification (grade)`
- `Admission grade`
- `Curricular units (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grade)`
- `Unemployment rate`
- `Inflation rate`
- `GDP`

#### 4.1.3 Categorical type
- `Marital status`
- `Application mode`
- `Course`
- `Previous qualification`
- `Nacionality`
- `Mother's qualification`

### 4.2 Detailed data description
The dataset includes features related to students' demographics, academic history, and socio-economic factors, providing a comprehensive view of their educational backgrounds and current standing.

## 5. Target Variable
- **Target**: A categorical variable indicating the academic risk classification (dropout, enrolled, graduate). Present in the training set but absent in the test set.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
The primary evaluation metric is **accuracy**, representing the proportion of true results among all predictions made.

## 7. Submission Format
The submission file must include a header and follow this format:
```
id,Target
76518,Graduate
76519,Graduate
76520,Graduate
```

## 8. Other Key Aspects
The dataset is synthetically generated, encouraging participants to explore the original dataset for insights into feature distributions. The competition runs from June 1 to June 30, 2024, with specific deadlines for submissions.
