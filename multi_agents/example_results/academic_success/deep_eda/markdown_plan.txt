- **Involved Features:**
  - `Previous qualification (grade)`
  - `Admission grade`
  - `Curricular units 1st sem (credited)`
  - `Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)`
  - `Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)`
  - `Curricular units 1st sem (approved)`
  - `Curricular units 1st sem (grade)`
  - `Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)`
  - `Curricular units 2nd sem (credited)`
  - `Curricular units 2nd sem (enrolled)`
  - `Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations)`
  - `Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)`
  - `Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)`
  - `Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)`
  - `Unemployment rate`
  - `Inflation rate`
  - `GDP`
  - `Age at enrollment`

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Generation of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for all numerical features.
- Textual descriptions of distribution shapes, including skewness and kurtosis.
- Identification of potential anomalies or unusual patterns in numerical features.
- Enhanced understanding of each numerical feature's behavior to guide further analysis and feature engineering.

Constraints:
- Ensure all numerical features are correctly typed (float/int) to avoid inaccuracies in statistics.
- Maintain computational efficiency by avoiding unnecessary calculations for symmetric distributions.
- Focus only on significant anomalies that could impact model performance.

### STEP 2
Task: Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Tools:** Pandas (`value_counts()`)
- **Involved Features:**
  - `Marital status`
  - `Application mode`
  - `Course`
  - `Previous qualification`
  - `Nacionality`
  - `Mother's qualification`
  - `Father's qualification`
  - `Mother's occupation`
  - `Father's occupation`
  - `Displaced`
  - `Educational special needs`
  - `Debtor`
  - `Tuition fees up to date`
  - `Gender`
  - `Scholarship holder`
  - `International`

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Tables showing frequency counts and proportions for each category within every categorical feature.
- Summary of class imbalances, highlighting features with categories that dominate or are underrepresented.
- Identification of potential data quality issues, such as unexpected categories or inconsistent labeling.
- Improved understanding of categorical feature distributions to inform feature engineering and ensure balanced data for modeling.

Constraints:
- Ensure categories are correctly labeled without inconsistencies (e.g., case sensitivity, typos).
- Focus on imbalances exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., categories constituting less than 5% of the data).
- Document only issues that have a clear impact on analysis or model performance.

### STEP 3
Task: Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Tools:** Pandas, SciPy
- **Involved Features:**
  - **Numerical:** All numerical features listed in Step 1
  - **Categorical:** All categorical features listed in Step 2
  - **Target Variable:** `Target`

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Tables summarizing descriptive statistics of numerical features segmented by each target class (`dropout`, `enrolled`, `graduate`).
- Tables showing the distribution of categorical features across target classes, emphasizing significant associations.
- Summary of association metrics (e.g., CramÃ©r's V, Chi-Square tests for categorical; Pearson/Spearman correlations for numerical features) indicating strong relationships with the target.
- Prioritized list of features with significant associations to the target variable, guiding feature engineering and model focus.

Constraints:
- Ensure segments have sufficient sample sizes for meaningful comparisons.
- Interpret only statistically significant associations to avoid misleading conclusions.
- Avoid features that may lead to data leakage or are based on unrealistic scenarios.

### STEP 4
Task: Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features
Tools, involved features and correct parameters:
- **Tools:** Pandas, Statsmodels
- **Involved Features:** All numerical features listed in Step 1

Expected output or Impact on data:
- Correlation matrix showing pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between numerical features, highlighting strong relationships (|r| > 0.7).
- List of feature pairs with high correlations (e.g., |r| > 0.8) indicating potential multicollinearity.
- Table of Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) scores for each numerical feature, identifying those with high multicollinearity (e.g., VIF > 5).
- Recommendations for composite features or feature transformations based on correlation and multicollinearity insights.
- Informed decisions on feature selection and engineering to enhance model efficacy and reduce multicollinearity issues.

Constraints:
- Limit the display of the correlation matrix to high correlations to maintain readability.
- Perform VIF calculations only on features without missing values.
- Ensure that composite features logically capture essential information and are not merely mathematical artifacts.
